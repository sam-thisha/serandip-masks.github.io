                    <h3 class="blog-title">Masks used in Rituals</h3>  
                    <p>Sri Lanka is famous for its demon masks used in various dramatic rituals.
                       They are divided into myths, animal spirits, demons and human figures. 
                       While the meaning and design of mythological masks are related to folk-religious iconography, 
                       the meaning and design of human masks have evolved in recent times. 
                       Sri Lanka's authentic mask and masking tradition is an exceptional cultural phenomenon, 
                       with a short history of an ancient civilization with traces of hunter-gatherer societies. 
                       The Veddas preserve a wide variety of rituals and practices of face, pantomime and body painting, 
                       some of which are directly related to ancestor worship. These attempts to evoke the supernatural 
                       are also evident in other parts of the world where hunter-gatherer societies still exist.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-title">What is the symbolism of the color, shape, facial expression of the mask?</h3>  
                    <p>The color of the masks typically represents the color of the demon, which they believed 
                       looked like it. The masks frequently had the same form style, which was long, narrow,
                       and pointy. The mask's facial movements are bizarre. Some would appear silly, while 
                       others would appear menacing. Intimidating masks would have sharp, pointy teeth and 
                       bulging eyes, whereas foolish masks would have less intense pupils and smile with 
                       human-like teeth.</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-title">Fire</h4>
                    <p>The Ginidella Raksha mask is a Raksha mask, which indicates that its purpose is to protect 
                       the wearer from evil. The colors of this mask symbolize the emotion of rage, which is why 
                       it is red, orange, and yellow. All evil is repelled by the designs on the ears. The patterns 
                       on the ears and face really catch your eye, which the Sri Lankans thought was very essential.</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-title">Snake</h4>
                    <p>The Naga Raksha mask, also known as the Snake Demon, is decorated with a variety of hues and patterns. 
                        The most obvious and appealing pattern is the cobra-shaped hair, hence the name Snake Demon. 
                        It has a long Tung to smell its enemies and teeth to eat them, which are the Sri Lankans in this instance.</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-title">Peacock</h4>
                    <p>The bright beautiful colors white and blue on the Peacock mask are meant to promote peace and harmony.
                       A peacock is also thought to offer harmony and peace. This mask also serves as a deterrent to evil 
                       entities and ghosts.</p>

                    <p>This ritual was designed to heal the sick, and thus the Raksha masks were made. The Raksha masks 
                       were originally created for use in those ceremonies. The witch doctor wears these masks to imitate 
                       the devils' imaginary faces, which were thought to be the source of the illness. The doctor then 
                       moves to the beat of the drum, driving away the demons. Raksha masks were and still are used in 
                       Kolam Maduwa to conduct Raksha dances. Legend has it that Sri Lanka was once governed by the Rakshasas, 
                       whose king was Ravana from the Ramayana. Raksha masks are now used in many festivals and traditional dances,
                       as well as being sold to the tourist trade.</p>
